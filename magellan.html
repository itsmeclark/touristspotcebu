    <h2>MAGELLAN CROSS</h2>
    <h5>Magellan Cross is a huge wooden Christian cross that marks the arrival of Portuguese explorer Ferdinand <br>
        Magellan on the island of Sugbu (now Cebu) roughly 500 years ago. He and his crew were the first Europeans<br>
        to come to Philippines, on a mission to search for the spice islands of Molucca for the King of Spain. Magellan<br>
        met and befriended the native chief, Rajah Humabon, and eventually, he, his wife, and his native warriors<br>
        agreed to be baptized into the Roman Catholic faith. Magellan planted the cross to signify this important event.<br>
        It also marked the beginning of the propagation of the Christian reliaion all over the country.</h5>
