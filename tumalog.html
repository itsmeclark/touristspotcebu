    <h2>TUMALOG FALLS</h2>
    <h5>Tumalog Falls is a tall and wide waterfall located close by the <br>
        popular tourist hotspot of Oslob on Cebu Island, the Philippines.<br> 
        Although this waterfall is not known for its impressive flow of water,<br>
        it's sheer height and width definitely impressed us.</h5>
