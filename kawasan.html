    <h2>KAWASAN FALLS</h2>
    <h5>The Kawasan Falls is a three-stage cascade of clear turquoise water from mountain springs located<br> in the jungles of the Cebu island. 
        The falls are part of the Kawasan River in Badian, Cebu, in the Philippines.<br> The water from the falls originates from the Kabukalan
        Spring and passes through the Kawasan gorge en<br> route to the Matutinao River and the Tanon Strait. The largest waterfall is about 40
        meters high, followed by<br> smaller cascades and turquoise water pools that invite swimming. It is a popular tourist destination and is<br> known
        for its tranquil and relaxing environment, and the adventurous can even enjoy a raft ride or a dive off<br> cliffs.</h5>
